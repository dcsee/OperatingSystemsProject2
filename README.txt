External References:

	We used the online C++ documentation at www.cplusplus.com as a reference for how to create and access STL objects. Specifically, we used the references for the list and vector data types. Links to the specific pages are provided below:

	We used Piazza extensively to keep up-to-date with other students' questions, and with Professor Nitta's answers. We also discussed the project with other students who happened to be using the computer lab at the same time as us. However, we did not share code directly or copy code from any other students. Any similarities between our code and other students code, due to reading Piazza or via casually discussing the project with classmates, are purely coincidental.
	
	Lastly, in creating the class ThreadStore, we used an implementation for the Singleton design pattern provided by Professor Nitta. Professor Nitta made this resource was available to all students in a public Piazza post.
